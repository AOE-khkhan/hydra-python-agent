Requirements for redis_graph.py file acoording to my local env.
    install redis-graph ref: http://redisgraph.io/#linux-ubuntu-1604
    install and load module redis ref: http://redisgraph.io/#loading-the-module-to-redis
    now for python client usage:
    pip install redis
    pip install redisgraph       // you can change the client.py with your requirements
    and then first run the redis server and then run redis_graph.py file
    
    
    
After install redis-graph, redis and its python client 
you should do :
    $cd redis
    $src/redis-server --loadmodule /path_to_redis_graph/src/redisgraph.so
    like  this:
    src/redis-server --loadmodule /home/sandeep/demo/redis-module-graph/src/redisgraph.so
 it will run the redis server then you can run your redis file in different terminal but in same env.   

    **docker image will provided early for now you can use the same configuration.
