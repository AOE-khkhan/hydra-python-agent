    install redis-graph ref: http://redisgraph.io/#linux-ubuntu-1604
    install and load module redis ref: http://redisgraph.io/#loading-the-module-to-redis

    pip install redisgraph // you can change the client.py with your requirements
    and then first run the redis server and then run redis_graph.py file
